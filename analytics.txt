1. Libraries used:
    Matplotlib -
        Advantages: It's a very lightweight and easy library to use. It's very powerful and gives full control. Good documentation and resources online.
        Disadvantages: It's mostly visualization, relies on pandas for analysis.
    leather -
        Advantages: User friendly, .Easy to use. Generates svg files
        Disadvantages: Unlike plotly, no responsive/dynamic graphs.

2. Graphs plotted:
    Scatter plot:
                  This was chosen because it provides relationship between temperature and humidity.
                  It can be seen that as the temperature increases humidity decreases .
                  At lower temperature the humidity was more than 50%
                  At the average temperature of 44*c the humidity was 30%
    Boxplot:
                  Gives 5 point distribution metric in a single figure. (minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile, maximum and outliers). That's a lot of information in a single figure displayed in sophisticated manner.
                  It gives the distribution of temperature and humidity and helps us understand the range in which the these values usually reside.
                  The median temperature to be around 44*c and the median humidity to be around 27%
                  Temperature is ranging from 39*c to 47*c and humidity is ranging from 22% to 37%
