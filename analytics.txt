1. Libraries used:
    Matplotlib -
        Advantages: It's a very lightweight and easy library to use. It's very powerful and gives full control. Good documentation and resources online.
        Disadvantages: It's mostly visualization, relies on pandas for analysis.
    Seaborn - (used pandas to create dataframe)
        Advantages: It's more high level and based on matplotlib. Provides great functionality out of the box. Good documentation and resources online. Easy to use.
        Disadvantages: relies on pandas for analysis. Unlike plotly, no responsive/dynamic graphs.

2. Graphs plotted:
    Scatter plot: This was chosen because it provides relationship between temperature and humidity.
    Boxplot: Gives 5 point distribution metric in a single figure. (minimum, 1st quartile, median, 3rd quartile, maximum and outliers). That's a lot of information in a single figure displayed in sophisticated manner.
